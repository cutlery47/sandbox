|Neutral 50
|When you return topside, I think you'll see that my Securitron army is a little more than the Legion was prepared to handle.<!--{{Inline quote|sound=CreatureUniqueMrHouse VHDHouseBattle_GREETING_001554D8_3.ogg}}-->
|{{linkable|4}}

|-
|Neutral 50
|Oh, and before you go - grab that print-out spooling from the console here - those papers set the terms for the NCR's unconditional surrender.<!--{{Inline quote|sound=CreatureUniqueMrHouse VHDHouseBattle_GREETING_001554D8_4.ogg}}-->

|Neutral 50
|''{FIRST, BUNKER, BENNY FLED}'' I do wish you'd come and met with me at the Lucky 38 when you first arrived on the Strip. Or after Benny fled, even.<!--{{Inline quote|sound=CreatureUniqueMrHouse VDialogueMrHouse_GREETING_0014B665_1.ogg}}-->

|{{linkable|9}}

|{{linkable|16}}

|-
|Neutral 50

|{{linkable|18}}

|-
|rowspan="3" |GREETING
|Neutral 50
|I need you to manually upload the data from the Chip to the facility's primary computer. There's a terminal at the other end of this facility.<!--{{Inline quote|sound=CreatureUniqueMrHouse VDialogueMrHouse_GREETING_0014B66D_2.ogg}}-->

|{{linkable|23}}

|-
|Neutral 50
|Singlehandedly, you've brought mankind's best hopes of forward progress crashing down. No punishment would be too severe.<!--{{Inline quote|sound=CreatureUniqueMrHouse VDialogueMrHouse_GREETING_0014B66E_3.ogg}}-->

|{{linkable|36}}

|-
|rowspan="2" |GREETING
|Neutral 50
|''{FIRST, BENNY FLED}'' The point of my inviting you to visit me here at the Lucky 38 ''{emphasis}'' before stomping into the Tops on your own was to help you prepare - tactically.<!--{{Inline quote|sound=CreatureUniqueMrHouse VDialogueMrHouse_GREETING_0014EADD_1.ogg}}-->
|{{linkable|37}}

|-
|Neutral 50
|Now, because of your carelessness, Benny has fled the Strip, taking with him the Platinum Chip.<!--{{Inline quote|sound=CreatureUniqueMrHouse VDialogueMrHouse_GREETING_0014EADD_2.ogg}}-->

|-
|rowspan="2" |GREETING
|Neutral 50
|''{FIRST DISCUSS, PLAYER VISITED TOPS}'' ''{welcoming player, trying to hide irritation}'' Well... this meeting has been a long time in coming... longer still, since you took time to ''{disapproving}'' charge into the Tops before coming to see me.<!--{{Inline quote|sound=CreatureUniqueMrHouse VDialogueMrHouse_GREETING_00118A19_1.ogg}}-->
|{{linkable|39}}

|{{linkable|43}}

|-
|GREETING
|Neutral 50
|''{LATER, BENNY FLED}'' Events have transpired in a... ''{beat}'' less-than-optimal fashion. Benny has fled the Strip, and the Platinum Chip has not been recovered.<!--{{Inline quote|sound=CreatureUniqueMrHouse VDialogueMrHouse_GREETING_0014B673_1.ogg}}-->

|{{linkable|47}}

|-
|rowspan="4" |GREETING
|Neutral 50
|''{HOUSE RECEIVES CHIP}'' ''{tenderly regarding the Chip}'' Such a small thing, isn't it? And yet so... ''{capacious = inexhaustibly capable}'' capacious. So very dear.<!--{{Inline quote|sound=CreatureUniqueMrHouse VDialogueMrHouse_GREETING_00120F26_1.ogg}}-->
|{{linkable|48}}

|-
|Neutral 50
|Decades of hiring salvagers out west to search for this little ''{beat}'' relic in the ruins of a place called Sunnyvale. Back then, anyway.<!--{{Inline quote|sound=CreatureUniqueMrHouse VDialogueMrHouse_GREETING_00120F26_2.ogg}}-->
|{{linkable|49}}

|-
|Neutral 50
|That's where the Chip was printed, on October 22, 2077. It was to have been hand-delivered to me here, at the Lucky 38, the next day. <!--{{Inline quote|sound=CreatureUniqueMrHouse VDialogueMrHouse_GREETING_00120F26_3.ogg}}-->
|{{linkable|50}}
